:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
Output is a **number** | Output is a **fuzzy set**
Good for **regression** and prediction | Good for more softer approaches like **Medical Diagnosis**
Less intuitive to interpret (numeric values) | More intuitive to interpret 
Defuzzification process is simple and more computationally efficient | Complex defuzzification process, can take time to process
Less accurate | More accurate
Weighted average as final output | Many methods for final output
